# Postman-Personal
Collections I'm working on - those of interest to the broader Ping Identity audience will be moved over to the Ping Repository

Those posted here are not all in a finished state - but could be used to start working with Ping Identity APIs.

## Collection - Consent API

This Collection is built to:

* Demonstrate the Consent API in PingDirectory
* Train PingIntelligence with appropriate calls
* Attack PingIntelligence with inappropriate calls

The "Training" folder contains calls that show correct usage of the API

*Notes*: 

Consent Definitions need to be created in PingDirectory Admin Console first

Some calls contain hardcoded mapping of Definitions to Audience. If you want to use this against your own instance of Consent API, the array is held in Collection Variables
